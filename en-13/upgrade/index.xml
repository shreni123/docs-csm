      <description>Upgrade Automation This document describes how the CSM upgrade process is automated.
Overview In a nutshell, an upgrade is:
 Upload new artifacts into a running system. Rebuild each NCN with the newly uploaded images. Deploy new charts after all NCNs are upgraded.  Prerequisites Everything that is needed before upgrading an NCN.
 NOTE:
The prerequisites.sh script is required to run on both ncn-m001 and ncn-m002 (at different points in the upgrade process).</description>

      <description>CSM 1.2.0 or later to 1.3.0 Upgrade Process Introduction This document guides an administrator through the upgrade of Cray Systems Management from v1.0 to v1.2. When upgrading a system, follow this top-level file from top to bottom. The content on this top-level page is meant to be terse. For additional reference material on the upgrade processes and scripts mentioned explicitly on this page, see resource material.
Important Notes Service request adjustments are needed for small systems   For systems with only three worker nodes (typically Testing and Development Systems (TDS)), prior to proceeding with this upgrade, CPU limits MUST be lowered on several services in order for this upgrade to succeed.</description>

      <description>Prepare for Upgrade Before beginning an upgrade to a new version of CSM, there are a few things to do on the system first.
 Reduced resiliency during upgrade Start typescript Running sessions Health validation Stop typescript Preparation completed  Reduced resiliency during upgrade Warning: Management service resiliency is reduced during the upgrade.
Although it is expected that compute nodes and application nodes will continue to provide their services without interruption, it is important to be aware that the degree of management services resiliency is reduced during the upgrade.</description>

      <description>Upgrade CSM The process for upgrading Cray Systems Management (CSM) has many steps in multiple procedures which should be done in a specific order.
After the upgrade of CSM software, the CSM health checks will validate the system before doing any other operational tasks like the check and update of firmware on system components. Once the CSM upgrade has completed, other product streams for the HPE Cray EX system can be installed or upgraded.</description>

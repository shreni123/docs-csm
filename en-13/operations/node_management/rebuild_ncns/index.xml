      <description>Post Rebuild Storage Node Validation Validate the storage node rebuilt successfully.
Skip this section if a master or worker node was rebuilt.
Procedure   Verify there are 3 mons, 3 mds, 3 mgr processes, and rgws.
ceph -s Example output:
 cluster: id: 22d01fcd-a75b-4bfc-b286-2ed8645be2b5 health: HEALTH_OK services: mon: 3 daemons, quorum ncn-s001,ncn-s002,ncn-s003 (age 4m) mgr: ncn-s001(active, since 19h), standbys: ncn-s002, ncn-s003 mds: cephfs:1 {0=ncn-s001=up:active} 2 up:standby osd: 12 osds: 12 up (since 2m), 12 in (since 2m) rgw: 3 daemons active (ncn-s001.</description>

      <description>Power Cycle and Rebuild Nodes This section applies to all node types. The commands in this section assume the variables from the prerequisites section have been set.
Procedure   Open and watch the console for the node being rebuilt.
  Log in to a second session to use it to watch the console using the instructions at the link below:

      <description>Prepare Storage Nodes Prepare a storage node before rebuilding it.
IMPORTANT: All of the output examples may not reflect the cluster status where this operation is being performed. For example, if this is a rebuild in place, then Ceph components will not be reporting down, in contrast to a failed node rebuild.
Prerequisites If rebuilding ncn-s001, it is critical that the storage-ceph-cloudinit.sh has been removed from the runcmd in BSS.</description>

      <description>Re-Add a Storage Node to Ceph Use the following procedure to re-add a Ceph node to the Ceph cluster.
NOTE This operation can be done to add more than one node at the same time.
Add Join Script   Copy and paste the below script into /srv/cray/scripts/common/join_ceph_cluster.sh.
NOTE This script may also available in the /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts directory where the latest docs-csm RPM is installed. If so, it can be copied from that node to the new storage node being rebuilt and skip to step 2.</description>

      <description>Rebuild NCNs Rebuild a master, worker, or storage non-compute node (NCN). Use this procedure in the event that a node has a hardware failure, or some other issue with the node has occurred that warrants rebuilding the node.
Prerequisites The system is fully installed and has transitioned off of the LiveCD.
Variables set with the name of the node being rebuilt and its component name (xname) are required.
 Set NODE to the hostname of the node being rebuilt (e.</description>

      <description>Validate BOOTRAID Artifacts Perform the following steps on ncn-m001.
  Initialize the cray command and follow the prompts (required for the next step).
cray init   Run the script to ensure the local BOOTRAID has a valid kernel and initrd.
/opt/cray/tests/install/ncn/scripts/validate-bootraid-artifacts.sh   Workaround: CASMINST-2015 As a result of rebuilding any NCN(s), remove any dynamically assigned interface IP addresses that did not get released automatically by running the CASMINST-2015 script:</description>

      <description>Final Validation Steps Use this procedure to finish validating the success of a rebuilt NCN(s).
Procedure   Confirm what the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configurationStatus is for the desiredConfig after rebooting the node.
NOTE The following command will indicate if a CFS job is currently in progress for this node.
IMPORTANT: The following command assumes that the variables from the prerequisites section have been set.

This section applies to all node types. The commands in this section assume the variables from the prerequisites section have been set.
Procedure   Generate the BSS boot parameters JSON file.
Run the following commands from a node that has cray CLI initialized:
